# Daily DSA Practice Repository
Created a centralized repository for daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, consolidating implementations in Python to enhance coding proficiency and streamline technical interview preparation. The project includes a comprehensive collection of algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming) and data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs), organized for accessibility and consistent practice. Hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/AbhinavKumar0000/DSA_practice), this open-source project showcases expertise in problem solving, algorithm optimization, and coding proficiency, providing a robust resource for competitive programming and software development.
